# Pygame Zero Space Invaders 

This is a replica of the classical Space Invaders Game, created using Pygame Zero, with an object oriented programming approach.


To run the game:
```
pgzrun main.py  
```

The game is still very much a work in progress, but some simple functionallity is implemented:

- Move SpaceShip
- Fire lasers from SpaceShip
- Create weak (low level) Enemies
- Detect laser hits
- Remove enemies with damage level above threshold 

TODO:
- Add a scoring system 
- Detect game over (when at least one enemy reaches the bottom of the screen)
- "Game Over"-screen 
- Add multiple types of enemies:
	- Some with higher damage tolerance 
	- Make enemies with harder damage tolerance appear when the game progresses (i.e. higher levels are reached)
